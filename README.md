logger
======
Just a shot at the Meteor JS framework.
Nothing to serious - supposed to allow the user to login with his FB, and then track exercise and calorie intake.

#Installation

You need to install nodeJS and npm before you can run this project.
After that:

    curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
    git clone git@github.com:vidirr/logger.git
    npm install meteorite -g
    mrt install
    meteor
    
Voila.
